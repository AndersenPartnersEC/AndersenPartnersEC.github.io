                                Neither Andersen & Partners nor its partners, principals, consultants, represent that the student will gain admission to any particular college or university and neither Andersen & Partners nor its partners, principals, consultants are responsible in any way for the student’s failure to gain such admission. Due to the ever increasing number of applicants and the declining number of admits, no student can be assured of admission at any particular college or university, no matter how strong that student is academically. H&C specializes in helping students present their “best side” to universities and, as such, the student is able to maximize his/her chances for admission. Andersen & Partners provides predictions of the student’s chances of being admitted to particular schools based on historical data, our experience in working with students, and experience applying to top US schools. Andersen & Partners does not make any express or implied warranties, guarantees, assurances or representations to the Client with respect to the Services. Without limiting the foregoing, any implied warranty or condition is expressly excluded and disclaimed.</p>
